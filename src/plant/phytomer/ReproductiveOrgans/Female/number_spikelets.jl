    NumberSpikelets(TT_flowering=6300.0, duration_dev_spikelets=675.0)

Determines the number of spikelets on the fruit bunch.

# Arguments

- `TT_flowering`: thermal time for flowering since phytomer appearence (degree days).
- `duration_dev_spikelets`: period of thermal time before flowering that determines the number of spikelets on the fruit bunch (degree days).
