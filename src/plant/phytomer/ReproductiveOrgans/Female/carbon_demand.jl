Carbon demand of the female inflorescence based on the potential fruit biomass

# Arguments

- `respiration_cost`: growth respiration cost (g g⁻¹)
- `respiration_cost_oleosynthesis`: respiration cost during oleosynthesis (g g⁻¹)
- `TT_flowering`: thermal time for flowering since phytomer appearance (degree days).
- `TT_fruiting`: thermal time for fruit setting since phytomer appearance (degree days).
- `duration_bunch_development`: duration between fruit set and bunch maturity (ready for harvest) (degree days).
- `duration_oleosynthesis`: duration of oleosynthesis (degree days).
- `duration_dev_stalk`: duration of stalk development (degree days).
- `duration_fruit_setting`: period of thermal time after flowering that determines the number of flowers in the bunch that become fruits, *i.e.* fruit set (degree days).
- `fraction_period_oleosynthesis`: fraction of the duration between flowering and harvesting when oleosynthesis occurs
- `fraction_period_stalk`: fraction of the duration between flowering and harvesting when stalk development occurs

# Inputs

- `final_potential_biomass_non_oil_fruit`: potential fruit biomass that is not oil (g fruit-1)
- `final_potential_biomass_oil_fruit`: potential oil biomass in the fruit (g fruit-1)
- `TEff`: daily effective temperature (°C)
- `TT_since_init`: thermal time since the first day of the phytomer (degree days)
- `state`: state of the leaf

# Outputs

- `carbon_demand`: total carbon demand (g[sugar])
- `carbon_demand_oil`: carbon demand for oil production (g[sugar])
- `carbon_demand_non_oil`: carbon demand for non-oil production (g[sugar])
- `carbon_demand_stalk`: carbon demand for stalk development (g[sugar])
