    build_mockup(parameters; merge_scale=:leaflet)

Construct a mockup of an oil palm plant architecture using the specified parameters.

# Arguments

- `parameters::Dict`: Dictionary containing model parameters for the oil palm plant architecture. 
- `merge_scale::Symbol`: (optional) The scale at which to merge geometry.
    - `:node`: Geometry is not merged, each node has its own mesh (finer scale is leaflet segments).
    - `:leaflet` (default): Geometry is merged at the leaflet level.
    - `:leaf`: All geometry for a leaf is merged into a single mesh.
    - `:plant`: All plant geometry is merged into a single mesh.

# Description

The `merge_scale` argument controls how the geometry is structured within the Multiscale Tree Graph (MTG). The resulting mesh is identical in all cases, but its organization differs.

- Using `:leaflet` retains the finest detail, with each leaflet having its own mesh. This is best for analyses like light interception at the organ level.
- Using `:leaf` or `:plant` merges geometry into larger components. A single mesh for the whole plant (`:plant`) is the most performant for rendering, but it prevents querying information for individual organs from the mesh (e.g., which part of the mesh is a given leaflet).

# Returns

- `mtg`: An MTG (Multiscale Tree Graph) representing the oil palm plant architecture, including geometry at the specified merge scale.

# Example

```julia
using VPalm
file = joinpath(dirname(dirname(pathof(VPalm))), "test", "files", "parameter_file.yml")
parameters = read_parameters(file)
mtg = build_mockup(parameters; merge_scale=:plant)
```
