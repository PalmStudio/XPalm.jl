- `leaflets_type_frequency`: Vector of NamedTuples representing frequency distributions along the rachis (if *e.g.* 10 values are provided, it means the rachis is divided into 10 sub-sections), with fields:

  - `low`: Frequency of plane=-1 leaflets (terminal leaflets in groups), *i.e.* leaflets on "low" position
- `rng`: Random number generator.

# Details

This function:

    1. Organizes leaflets into groups based on position-dependent size distributions
    2. Assigns a spatial plane to each leaflet within a group:
        - The first leaflet in each group is always placed on the high position (plane=1)
        - Subsequent leaflets are positioned on medium (plane=0) or low (plane=-1) positions based on their frequency distribution at that rachis segment

## Biological Context

Grouping of leaflets is a key morphological feature in palm species, particularly in oil palm (Elaeis guineensis).
Unlike some palms with regularly spaced leaflets, oil palms exhibit distinctive clustering patterns where:

1. Leaflets occur in groups of variable sizes, but typically around 3 leaflets per group
2. Within each group, leaflets emerge at different angles:
   - The first leaflet points upward (high position)
   - Others point horizontally or downward (medium and low positions)
3. The pattern of grouping changes along the rachis:
   - Closer to the base: typically larger groups with more leaflets
   - Toward the tip: smaller groups or single leaflets

The model uses an inverse relationship between high-position leaflet frequency and group size to
recreate the natural variation in leaflet insertion angle - sections with many high-position leaflets have smaller groups (but more of them),
while sections with few high-position leaflets form larger groups.

The grouping pattern changes along the rachis, creating the characteristic appearance of palm fronds with varying leaflet arrangement 
patterns from base to tip.

1. Consistent, smaller spacing between leaflets within the same group
2. Larger spacing between adjacent groups

In palm fronds, leaflet length typically follows a bell-shaped distribution along the rachis:

1. Leaflets are short at the base (petiole end)
2. They increase in length to reach a maximum somewhere close to the middle of the rachis
3. They decrease in length toward the tip

The B point is a key morphological reference point where the rachis cross-section 
transitions from oval to round. By knowing the leaflet length at this specific point,
we can calculate the maximum leaflet length for the entire frond, which serves as
a scaling factor for all other leaflets.

The stochastic variation in B point position reflects natural biological variability
between individual palms or fronds.

Calculate the leaflet insertion angle in the vertical plane (in degrees).

# Arguments
- `relative_pos`: Relative position of the leaflet on the rachis [0 to 1].
- `leaflet_type`: Type of leaflet (-1=down, 0=medium, 1=up).
- `side`: Side of the leaf (1 for right, -1 for left).
- `high_a0_sup`: Upper bound of angle at position 0 for high position leaflets.
- `high_amax_sup`: Upper bound of maximum angle for high position leaflets.
- `high_a0_inf`: Lower bound of angle at position 0 for high position leaflets.
- `high_amax_inf`: Lower bound of maximum angle for high position leaflets.
- `low_a0_sup`: Upper bound of angle at position 0 for low position leaflets.
- `low_amax_sup`: Upper bound of maximum angle for low position leaflets.
- `low_a0_inf`: Lower bound of angle at position 0 for low position leaflets.
- `low_amax_inf`: Lower bound of maximum angle for low position leaflets.
- `rng`: Random number generator.

# Returns
- Vertical insertion angle in degrees.
